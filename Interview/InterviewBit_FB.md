## Arrays
### Exercises
*Rotate Matrix*
- It is important to learn to observe

*Max Sum Contiguous Subarray*
- Kind of tricky

---
## Math
### Exercises
*Rearrange Array*
- Tricky
- **Save two number in one number (%, +)**

---
## Binary Search
### Exercises
*Square Root of Integer*
- Totally, looping is better than recursion

---
## Strings
*Implement StrStr*
- Do things carefully

*Integer To Roman*
- The rule is the key:
- Ones place: I V
- Tens place: X L
- Hundreds place: C D
- Thousands place: M

*Roman To Integer*
- Be carefull

---
## Two Pointers
*Diffk*
- Think about the given condition
- Think carefully

*Intersection Of Sorted Arrays*
- Very basic and simple

---
## Linked Lists
*Add Two Numbers as Lists*
- Basic and simple
- Be carefull

---
## Stacks And Queues
*Evaluate Expression*
- A simple and basic question

---
## Backtracking
***All Unique Permutations***
- Feature: every choice is equal; next step depends on the last step;
- Method: create a check table; create a loop, every time execute a possible choice; create next recursion; recover the choice

*Combination Sum*
- d

---
## Hashing
*Substring Concatenation*
- d

*2 Sum*
- d

*Diffk II*
- d

---
## Tree Data Structure
*Least Common Ancestor*
- d

*Valid Binary Search Tree*
- d

---
## Dynamic Programming
*Longest Increasing Subsequence*
- d


*Unique Paths in a Grid*
- d

---
## Graph Data Structure & Algorithms
*Level Order*
- d

*Clone Graph*
- d
