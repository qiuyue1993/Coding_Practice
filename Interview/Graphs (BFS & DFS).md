# Notes
## Breath First Search (BFS)
- Queue
- For undirected graph, record the edge for two nodes

## Depth First Search (DFS)
- backtracking

## Minimum spanning tree
- Prim algorithm: choose shortest path every time
- Kruskal algorithm: rank all paths, choose shortest path every time 

## Shortest path
- Adjacency table: 
- Dijkstra algorithm: record every node's accessable node; find accessable and shortest city every time
- Floyd algorithm:

## Topological Sorting
- directed acyclic graph
- topological sorting: if edge <a,b> exists, a appears in front of vertex B; every vertex will be appear for once.
- greedyï¼ševery time, choose a vertex with 0 indegree; delete the vertex and modify edges; repeat
- DFS
